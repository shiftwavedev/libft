# libft
_libft is the first project in the 42 school cursus. The aim of this project is to deepen mastery of the C language through the creation of a library._

⚠️ : **This branch `_next` contains the evolution of my libft. That is, the addition of projects such as printf and get_next_line. As well as possible updates to libft functions.**
